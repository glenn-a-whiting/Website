                Avast! Welcome to my store's website.
                <br/><br/>
                I know, I know, the great Captain Jack Sparrow
                owning a store? But hey, something's gotta pay for
                the rum, and piratin's not as profitable as it
                used t' be.
				<br/><br/>
				Anyways, I'm selling off knives and forks and that,
				those rich english bastards love fancy forks, which I obtained
				from them fully legitimately, course.
				In the legitimately pirate fashion, that is.
                <br/><br/>
                No idea why people use these things,
                but apparently computers have become
                quite popular as of late. So anyway
                there's a bunch of stuff on here, you
                can find out where the store's at, see
                picture of my lovely store, and where
                you can shout at me and have me (pretend to) hear you.
                <br/><br/>
                But when you're done
                lollygagging at the pretty little box of
                lights, come down and throw some money
                at me!
